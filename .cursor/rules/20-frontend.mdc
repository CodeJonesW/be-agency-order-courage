# Frontend Guidance (fe-game-1)

## UI tone
- Calm, grounded, non-coercive.
- No streak visuals, no "XP bars", no dopamine UI.

## UX principles
- Always frame quests as a choice, not an obligation.
- One meaningful quest can define a day: prefer sparse screens.
- Reflection is optional; never force journaling.

## Anti-patterns
- “Daily quests” UI
- Pushy reminders language
- Reward animations that encourage grinding
