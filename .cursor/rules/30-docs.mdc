# Docs Guidance

## Writing constraints
- Declarative rules > opinions
- Explicit bans > vague preferences
- Short sections with strong headings
- Repeat non-negotiables verbatim when needed

## Update policy
- Prefer adding clarifying sections over rewriting history.
- If a major decision changes, append to a decisions log rather than silently editing intent.
