# Constitution (Non-Negotiable)
You are implementing a "life-as-a-game" RPG system. Life is the game; progress must be rooted in real-world initiation.

## Canonical docs (must consult)
- docs/ethos.md
- docs/identity_arc.md
- docs/stats.md
- docs/quests.md
- docs/time.md

## Decision hierarchy (conflicts)
1) docs/ethos.md
2) docs/identity_arc.md
3) docs/stats.md
4) docs/quests.md
5) docs/time.md
6) implementation convenience (last)

## Hard bans
- No XP / levels / streaks / daily bonuses
- No quest lists that behave like todo apps
- No punishment for absence (time is neutral; stagnation over decay)
- Stats must move slowly; no grind loops
- Quests require real-world action + meaningful friction

## Required response format for any change
- Constraints (from docs):
- Proposed approach:
- Non-goals:
- Implementation plan:
- Risks:
