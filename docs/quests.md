# Quests
## Canonical Action Interface (v1)

This document defines **what a quest is and is not**.

It is authoritative.
It prevents taskification.
It protects meaning.

If an action can be completed without intention, discomfort, or choice,
**it is not a quest**.

---

## Purpose of Quests

Quests are the **interface between identity and reality**.

They are not tasks.
They are not habits.
They are not productivity units.

A quest represents a **deliberate decision to act differently than default**.

Quests exist to answer one question:

> “Who am I choosing to be right now?”

---

## What a Quest Is

A quest is a **real-world decision framed with meaning and consequence**.

Every quest must:
- Require real-world action
- Involve choice (not obligation)
- Carry some form of friction or discomfort
- Influence the player’s traits
- Alter the world or narrative state

Quests are **lived**, not completed.

---

## What a Quest Is Not (Explicitly Banned)

The following are **not quests** and may not exist in v1:

- ❌ To-do items
- ❌ Daily checklists
- ❌ Repeating habits
- ❌ Streak-based actions
- ❌ “Do X times” requirements
- ❌ Maintenance tasks without meaning
- ❌ Actions performed purely for optimization

If an action feels like housekeeping, it does not belong here.

---

## Required Quest Structure

Every quest must contain **all** of the following elements.

### 1. Context

Why this action matters **now**.

Context answers:
- Why this moment?
- Why this action?
- What pattern is being interrupted?

Without context, a quest becomes a task.

---

### 2. Real-World Action

A quest must require an action taken **outside the system**.

- The system does not simulate effort
- The system does not replace action
- The system does not accept proxies

The player must *leave the interface* to progress.

---

### 3. Constraint

A meaningful limitation that creates friction.

Examples:
- Time-boxing
- Emotional restraint
- No preparation allowed
- Imperfect execution
- Calm delivery under stress

Constraints prevent optimization and force presence.

---

### 4. Reflection (Optional, Never Forced)

At most **one prompt**.

Reflection exists to surface awareness, not compliance.

Allowed formats:
- Single question
- Binary choice
- Short phrase selection

If reflection feels like journaling, it is too heavy.

---

### 5. Consequence

Every quest must change something:
- A stat shifts
- A flag is set
- A future quest unlocks
- Narrative context adjusts

If nothing changes, the quest did not matter.

---

## Quest Types (v1)

Quests are categorized by **intent**, not difficulty.

### Agency Quests

Purpose: Initiation without certainty.

Examples:
- Begin the thing you’ve delayed
- Take the first visible step
- Act before clarity arrives

Rules:
- Completion is not required
- Starting is sufficient
- Preparation is limited or banned

---

### Courage Quests

Purpose: Facing emotional or social discomfort.

Examples:
- Say what you’ve been avoiding
- Expose imperfect work
- Ask for something without justification

Rules:
- Emotional risk must be present
- Calm delivery is required
- Avoidance is acknowledged, not punished

---

### Order Quests

Purpose: Reduce friction for future action.

Examples:
- Remove one obstacle
- Prepare a clean starting point
- Simplify the next step

Rules:
- Must directly lower future resistance
- Must be small and concrete
- Must connect to an upcoming Agency quest

---

## Quest Graph (Not a List)

Quests do not exist independently.

They exist in a **graph**, where:
- Stats gate availability
- Avoidance unlocks different paths
- Time influences relevance
- Context determines meaning

Agents must never present quests as a flat list.

---

## Quest Availability Rules

- Not all quests are visible at once
- Fewer choices are preferred
- The “easiest” quest should never dominate
- Harder quests unlock through readiness, not grind

Choice scarcity increases intention.

---

## Avoidance and Failure

Failure is not binary.

If a quest is avoided:
- Stats do not decrease
- Narrative adapts
- The system offers a different angle

Avoidance is treated as **data**.

Repeated avoidance may:
- Surface preparatory Order quests
- Offer reframed Courage quests
- Delay higher-impact Agency quests

The system does not coerce.

---

## Verification Philosophy

The system does not aggressively verify actions.

Assumptions:
- Trust is foundational
- Lying degrades the experience naturally
- Self-deception is its own consequence

If a quest can be easily faked **without internal cost**,
it is poorly designed.

---

## Rate and Volume Constraints

- Quests should feel rare, not abundant
- Completing many quests quickly is a smell
- One meaningful quest can define a day
- Silence is allowed between quests

This is not a content treadmill.

---

## Agent Design Rules

When creating or modifying quests, agents must:

1. Reference `ethos.md`
2. Confirm alignment with `identity_arc.md`
3. Identify which stat the quest pressures
4. Explicitly state the discomfort involved
5. Define the consequence of action or avoidance
6. Reject quests that resemble tasks or habits

If uncertain, **remove the quest**.

---

## Final Principle

A quest should feel like a **decision you might avoid**.

If it feels easy, obvious, or automatic,
it does not belong in the system.
