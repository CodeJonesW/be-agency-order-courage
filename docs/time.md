# Time
## Time as a Real and Irreversible Mechanic (v1)

This document defines how **time operates inside the system**.

It is authoritative.
It protects trust.
It prevents shame.

Time is not a scheduling tool.
Time is not a pressure tactic.

Time is a **neutral force that moves forward regardless of attention**.

---

## Core Principle

> **The game does not pause when the player is absent.  
> Time passes. Context changes. Opportunities shift.**

Time is treated as real, continuous, and irreversible.

This is essential to the “life as a game” ethos.

---

## What Time Is Not Used For

Time must **never** be used to:

- ❌ Enforce daily obligations
- ❌ Create streaks or streak loss
- ❌ Punish absence
- ❌ Reset progress
- ❌ Induce guilt or urgency
- ❌ Reward mere check-ins

If time pressure is used to manipulate behavior, the system has failed.

---

## Time as Context, Not Control

Time exists to:
- Change relevance
- Shift narrative framing
- Surface different choices
- Reflect momentum or inertia

Time does **not** exist to control behavior.

---

## Inactivity Is a Valid State

Absence is expected.

When a player does nothing:
- Stats do not rapidly decay
- Progress is not erased
- The system does not scold
- No alerts escalate in tone

Inactivity is treated as **information**, not neglect.

---

## Stagnation vs Decay

The system distinguishes clearly between:

### Stagnation (Primary Mechanism)

- Stats stop increasing
- Momentum slows
- Harder quests pause
- Preparatory or re-entry quests surface

Stagnation is the default response to inactivity.

---

### Decay (Rare, Narrative-Only)

- Decay is subtle and slow
- It applies only after extended avoidance
- It is framed narratively, not numerically
- It never feels punitive

If decay feels like loss, it is too aggressive.

---

## Time Windows and Expiration

Some quests are **time-sensitive**, but never urgent.

### Rules for Expiration

- Expiration reflects missed opportunity, not failure
- Expired quests do not penalize stats
- Narrative acknowledges closure neutrally
- New opportunities eventually replace old ones

Example framing:
> “That moment passed. Another will come.”

---

## Momentum as a Time Effect

Momentum emerges from **recent initiation**, not streaks.

- Recent Agency actions lower future resistance
- Gaps increase perceived friction
- Momentum is felt, not counted

Momentum is implicit, never shown as a number.

---

## Re-Entry After Absence

After meaningful absence, the system must:

1. Acknowledge the gap without judgment
2. Reduce cognitive load
3. Offer a single, stabilizing choice

### Re-Entry Quest Design

- Small
- Grounded
- Order- or Courage-focused
- No narrative pressure to “catch up”

Re-entry is about **returning to agency**, not compensating for time lost.

---

## Time and Narrative Tone

Narrative references to time must be:

- Observational
- Calm
- Non-accusatory
- Non-alarmist

Never say:
- “You should have…”
- “You missed…”
- “It’s been too long…”

Always imply:
- Continuity
- Patience
- Choice

---

## Agent Design Rules

When implementing time-based logic, agents must:

1. Assume absence is normal
2. Prefer stagnation over decay
3. Never surface guilt through language
4. Avoid daily or weekly resets
5. Use time to change context, not punish behavior
6. Ensure re-entry paths always exist

If a time mechanic pressures compliance, remove it.

---

## Implementation Guidance (High-Level)

- Track last meaningful action, not last login
- Time comparisons should be coarse, not granular
- Use ranges (e.g., “recent”, “long gap”) instead of exact counts
- Narrative should respond to *patterns*, not timestamps

Precision increases pressure.
Ambiguity preserves autonomy.

---

## Relationship to Other Systems

Time:
- Modulates quest relevance
- Influences narrative tone
- Affects stat stagnation
- Shapes re-entry paths

Time never directly:
- Awards stats
- Removes stats
- Forces action

---

## Final Principle

Time does not judge.

It simply moves forward.

The system’s role is not to fight time,
but to help the player **meet themselves honestly within it**.
