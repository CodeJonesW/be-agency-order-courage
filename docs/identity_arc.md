# Identity Arc
## Canonical Design Constraint (Strategy 2)

This document defines the **active Identity Arc** for the system.

It is authoritative.
It constrains scope.
It overrides convenience.

If a feature, mechanic, or decision does not serve this arc, **it does not ship**.

---

## What an Identity Arc Is

An Identity Arc is a **deliberate psychological transformation** the player is meant to live through.

It defines:
- A starting identity pattern
- A target identity pattern
- The pressures that force choice
- The traits that evolve as a result

It is not:
- A skill tree
- A progression system
- A content roadmap

It is the **spine** of the system.

All other design documents exist in service of the active Identity Arc.

---

## The Active Identity Arc (v1)

### **Reactive → Agentic**

This system’s first and foundational arc is the transition from **reactivity** to **agency**.

This arc is universal, observable, and prerequisite to all other meaningful change.

---

## Definition of States

### Reactive (Starting Pattern)

A reactive player tends to:
- Respond rather than initiate
- Delay decisions until forced
- Avoid discomfort despite knowing the cost
- Let environment dictate behavior
- Wait for clarity, permission, or motivation
- Feel “stuck,” “behind,” or perpetually preparing

Reactivity is not framed as failure.
It is framed as an understandable default state.

---

### Agentic (Emerging Pattern)

An agentic player begins to:
- Initiate action deliberately
- Act without full certainty
- Choose discomfort when appropriate
- Shape environment to reduce friction
- Trust their ability to follow through
- Experience momentum as self-generated

Agency is not perfection.
Agency is **initiation under uncertainty**.

---

## Purpose of This Arc

This arc exists to teach one core truth through lived experience:

> **Waiting is a choice.  
> Action is available before certainty.**

If the player internalizes this, the system has succeeded.

---

## Core Traits (High-Level)

The Reactive → Agentic arc is supported by a **small, intentional trait set**.

Exact mechanics are defined elsewhere, but the intent is fixed:

- **Agency** – the primary trait; the tendency to initiate meaningful action
- **Courage** – a supporting trait; willingness to face discomfort and uncertainty
- **Order** – a stabilizing trait; ability to reduce friction through structure

No additional traits may be introduced in v1.

---

## Zones Relevant to This Arc

Only Zones that actively pressure the Reactive → Agentic transition are included.

- **Mind** – indecision, rumination, clarity vs avoidance
- **Environment** – physical and digital friction
- **Relationships** – boundaries, conversations, social initiation

Zones not directly serving this arc (e.g. Body, Status, Achievement) are intentionally excluded from v1.

---

## What Progress Looks Like

Progress is not defined by volume or consistency.
It is defined by **shortened distance between intention and action**.

Signs the arc is working:
- The player initiates harder quests unprompted
- Avoidance is acknowledged without self-judgment
- Decisions happen earlier, with less rumination
- The player begins shaping their environment proactively

The system should surface these changes narratively.

---

## Failure and Stagnation

Within this arc:
- Avoidance does not reduce stats
- Inaction does not trigger punishment
- Shame is never applied

Instead:
- Progress stalls
- The system adapts
- Gentler or preparatory quests surface
- Narrative acknowledges hesitation neutrally

Stagnation is treated as **information**, not wrongdoing.

---

## Design Constraints (Non-Negotiable)

The following rules apply to all v1 decisions:

- No mechanic may reward passive completion
- No mechanic may reward checking boxes without discomfort
- No mechanic may bypass real-world initiation
- No feature may be added “for engagement” alone
- No system may optimize for streaks or daily obligation

If a mechanic allows optimization without personal discomfort, it violates the arc.

---

## Relationship to Other Documents

This document:
- Constrains `stats.md`
- Governs `quests.md`
- Shapes `time.md`
- Overrides implementation convenience

When conflicts arise:
1. `ethos.md` wins
2. `identity_arc.md` wins
3. All other documents yield

---

## Long-Term Outlook

Future Identity Arcs may exist, but:
- They are never layered simultaneously
- They are never rushed
- They never invalidate previous arcs

Agency is foundational.
All future growth assumes it.

---

## Final Assertion

This system does not ask the player to do more.

It asks the player to **stop waiting**.

Everything else is secondary.
